# HackITall-Deutsche-Bank
HackITall Project

Unity Project for 24h hackaton, as a solution to 
work from home problems. We address communication issues 
with current Zoom meetings, recreating them in a more 
realistic scenario, where you can go around talking to people,
or have everybody in the room connected to the same voice channel. 

The meeting rooms are highly customisable, having places where you can
sit and listen music together or join custom links. There is also the option
for personal customisation of your character!
