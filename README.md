HackITall Project

Main aspects of the project :

**Voice chat application, with regards to your proximity
*(Talk to your colleagues during meetings, and take private issues to another room!)

**Special zones where you can hear everybody, listen to music together or join links

**Customisable rooms and characters, show off your style in diverse enviroments! 

**3D Camera controls using mouse and movement from keyboard. Mute yourself trough on-screen buttons.


Unity Project for 24h hackaton, as a solution to 
work from home problems. We address communication issues 
with current Zoom meetings, recreating them in a more 
realistic scenario, where you can go around talking to people,
or have everybody in the room connected to the same voice channel. 

The meeting rooms are highly customisable, having places where you can
sit and listen music together or join custom links. There is also the option
for personal customisation of your character!

The solution is ready to deploy as a server and also easily joinable. 

Made using Unity3D  and Mirror + Dissonance API
